# Spotify-Popularity-Predictor
This was a group python project done by myself and assoumaaa(https://github.com/assoumaaa)

Using a public spotify dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/riteshpatil8998/spotify-dataset, we made a random forest model which we used to predict the popularity of songs on spotify using key featuers.

We began by cleaning data, that is, checking for missing values and duplicates,and then proceeded to data visualizations using the Matplotlib Python library to view the distribution of the data. We also checked for correlation among features, and then performed analysis on the most popular songs and artists, and also how various genres had changed over the years.

Then using tools available in the scikit learn library we tested how various machine learning models would work for the task of predicting a song's popularity, and eventually ended up with a Random Forest model.
